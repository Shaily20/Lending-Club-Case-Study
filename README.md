# Lending Club Case Study
The primary goal of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) case study is to identify the key factors and patterns that drive loan defaults, with a specific focus on distinguishing between loans that are "Fully Paid" and those that are "Charged Off."

The dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011.
### Understanding Loan Status and Data Limitations
The loan dataset includes a loan_status column, which categorizes loans into three states:
- Fully Paid: The borrower has successfully repaid the loan in full.
- Charged Off: The loan has been deemed uncollectible and is considered a loss for the lender (default).
- Current: The borrower is currently making payments, and the loan is in good standing.

If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

By focusing on loans with definitive outcomes ("Fully Paid" or "Charged Off"), we aim to uncover patterns and relationships that can help business:
- Identify High-Risk Borrowers: Determine the borrower characteristics, loan attributes, and credit history factors that are strong predictors of loan defaults.
- Inform Lending Decisions: Use the insights from EDA to refine lending policies, adjust interest rates based on risk, and develop more effective underwriting criteria.
